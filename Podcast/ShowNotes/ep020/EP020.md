#### Segment 1: *Understanding the Genius Syndrome*

At its core, it’s a form of impostor syndrome, where highly intelligent individuals feel an intense need to prove their worth, often with perfectionism, a strong self-image, and reluctance to admit mistakes.

- Relate this to tech:  
  > "Think about a genius coder or engineer you’ve worked with—brilliant, but maybe hard to work alongside. How often do we stop to consider what’s behind their behavior?"
