---

#### **Cold Open:** *(Background music fades in—energetic but subtle)*  

**Host (Paulin):**  
*"What if I told you that the man behind one of the biggest breakthroughs in battery technology didn’t start his career in a big company or flashy startup?  

Rachid Yazami, the scientist whose research helped power modern lithium-ion batteries, didn’t begin with a Silicon Valley internship or a prestigious tech job. He started with research, self-driven projects, and a mindset of proving his skills before being given an opportunity.  

And that’s exactly how you can build a resume—even if you don’t have traditional work experience.  

Today, we’re going to break down how to showcase your skills, frame your experience, and create a resume that makes employers take notice—just like Yazami did with his innovations. If you're trying to land your first job, this episode is for you."*

### **Intro** *(Music intensifies for a second and then fades out into a clean background sound.)*  

**Host (Paulin):**  
*"Welcome to today’s episode of Molomolo African Tech Stories. If you’re an aspiring engineer or tech professional struggling to fill out your resume because you don’t have a formal job yet, don’t worry—you’re not alone.  

Most people assume that without work experience, they have nothing to put on a resume. But that’s a mistake.  

Today, we’ll take lessons from Rachid Yazami’s journey—how he built credibility and changed the world of battery technology without starting in a big-name company. And we’ll turn those lessons into practical steps you can take to craft a resume that gets noticed."*

### **Main Section: HOW to Get There**  

#### **1. Your Work Doesn’t Need a Job Title to Be Valuable**  
*(Background music shifts subtly to a more thoughtful, storytelling tone.)*  

**Host (Paulin):**  
*"Think about this: When Rachid Yazami first started working on lithium-ion battery research, nobody hired him to do it. He wasn’t working for a major corporation. He was a PhD student experimenting with new materials, driven by curiosity.  

But his research—his self-initiated work—ended up revolutionizing the way batteries store energy. And later, that independent research landed him positions in top labs around the world.  

So, what’s the takeaway? You don’t need a formal job title to prove your skills. Your resume should highlight the *work you’ve done*, not just the jobs you’ve had.  

For example, instead of leaving blank space under ‘Experience,’ you could write:  
✅ **Developed an energy-efficient algorithm for battery monitoring using MATLAB, reducing computational time by 30%.**  
✅ **Designed and built a prototype drone navigation system as part of an independent project.**  

Your work has value—even if you weren’t paid for it."*

#### **2. Replace ‘Work Experience’ with ‘Projects & Research’**  
*(Music transitions into a more energetic, problem-solving vibe.)*  

**Host (Paulin):**  
*"Here’s a simple trick: If you don’t have work experience, rename that section on your resume to ‘Projects & Research.’  

This is exactly how Rachid Yazami built credibility. Before companies paid attention to him, he proved his expertise through published research.  

For example, let’s say you built an AI model for image recognition as part of a university project. Don’t just list ‘Worked on AI model.’ Instead, frame it like this:  

📌 **AI-Based Image Recognition System** *(Independent Project)*  
- Trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify medical images with 85% accuracy.  
- Implemented optimization techniques to reduce processing time by 20%.  

This shows you’ve applied your knowledge in a real way—even if it wasn’t for a company."*

#### **🎙 INTERLUDE: "Tech Concepts Explained… Badly" 🎙**  
*(Music shifts to a playful, lighthearted tone. Enter a guest voice, an engineer with a slightly dramatic storytelling style.)*  

**Guest (Engineer):**  
*"Alright, let’s talk about ‘experience’—or lack of it.  

Think of job hunting like cooking jollof rice for the first time. Imagine walking into a restaurant and saying, ‘I’ve never cooked before, but if you hire me as your chef, I’ll learn.’  

Would they hire you? Probably not.  

But what if you said, ‘I’ve been experimenting with different jollof recipes at home. I’ve tested cooking times, spice levels, and even optimized the water-to-rice ratio for better texture. Here’s a sample of my best dish.’  

Now, that’s proof.  

It’s the same in tech—don’t just say ‘I’m looking for experience.’ Show your work, like Yazami did with his research."*  

*(Music fades back to normal episode tone.)*

#### **3. Show Problem-Solving, Not Just Skills**  

**Host (Paulin):**  
*"Most resumes list skills like ‘Python, MATLAB, JavaScript.’ That’s fine, but it’s *boring.*  

Companies don’t hire skills—they hire problem-solvers.  

When Rachid Yazami proposed using graphite in lithium-ion batteries, he wasn’t just listing his knowledge of materials science. He was showing how he solved a problem: finding a stable, efficient way to store energy.  

Your resume should do the same. Instead of just saying, ‘Proficient in Python,’ try this:  

✅ **Built an automated web scraper in Python that collected and analyzed 10,000+ data points from e-commerce sites, improving trend analysis efficiency by 40%.**  

This tells a hiring manager, ‘This person doesn’t just *know* Python—they *use* it to solve real problems.’"*

### **INTERLUDE MATLAB Tutorial: Showcasing Your Resume Skills with a Lithium-Ion Battery Analysis Project**  
*(Background music shifts to a more hands-on, practical tone.)*  

**Host (Paulin):**  
*"One of the best ways to make up for a lack of formal experience is by showcasing your skills through projects. Instead of just listing ‘MATLAB’ on your resume, imagine impressing recruiters with a real-world project inspired by groundbreaking work—like Rachid Yazami’s research on lithium-ion batteries.

Dr. Yazami was instrumental in developing graphite anodes for lithium-ion batteries, revolutionizing energy storage. What if you could demonstrate your understanding of battery technology with a MATLAB project analyzing battery charge and discharge behavior? That’s exactly what we’ll do!"*  

#### **Project: Lithium-Ion Battery Charge/Discharge Analysis in MATLAB**  

*"Let’s say you want to showcase your ability to analyze energy storage systems. You can create a MATLAB script to model and visualize the charge-discharge characteristics of a lithium-ion battery."*  

```matlab
% MATLAB Resume Project: Lithium-Ion Battery Charge/Discharge Analysis
clc; clear; close all;

% Define battery parameters
capacity = 2.5; % Battery capacity in Ah
voltage_nominal = 3.7; % Nominal voltage in V
voltage_max = 4.2; % Maximum voltage in V
voltage_min = 3.0; % Minimum voltage in V
resistance_internal = 0.05; % Internal resistance in Ohms
time = 0:10:3600; % Time vector (seconds, over 1 hour)

% Simulate a simple charge-discharge cycle
current_charge = 1.0; % Charging current in A
current_discharge = -0.8; % Discharging current in A

% Compute voltage response using a simple model (Ohm's Law and SOC approximation)
voltage_charge = voltage_min + (time / max(time)) * (voltage_max - voltage_min) - current_charge * resistance_internal;
voltage_discharge = voltage_max - (time / max(time)) * (voltage_max - voltage_min) - current_discharge * resistance_internal;

% Plot results
figure;
plot(time/60, voltage_charge, 'b', 'LineWidth', 2);
hold on;
plot(time/60, voltage_discharge, 'r', 'LineWidth', 2);
xlabel('Time (minutes)');
ylabel('Battery Voltage (V)');
title('Lithium-Ion Battery Charge/Discharge Simulation');
legend('Charging', 'Discharging');
grid on;
hold off;

% Display key observations
fprintf('Nominal Voltage: %.2f V\n', voltage_nominal);
fprintf('Charge Current: %.2f A\n', current_charge);
fprintf('Discharge Current: %.2f A\n', current_discharge);
fprintf('Internal Resistance: %.2f Ohms\n', resistance_internal);
```

#### **How to Present This in an Interview**  
**Host (Paulin):**  
*"Now, instead of just listing ‘MATLAB’ on your resume, you could frame your experience like this:*  

- **Project:** Simulated lithium-ion battery charge-discharge behavior using MATLAB.  
- **Skills Applied:** Battery modeling, electrical circuit analysis, and data visualization.  
- **Impact:** Developed a simplified model to estimate voltage response under different current loads.  

Then, if an interviewer asks, ‘Can you tell me about a time you used MATLAB?’—you already have a structured answer using the STAR method:  

- **Situation:** Wanted to understand how lithium-ion batteries behave under charge and discharge conditions.  
- **Task:** Develop a MATLAB script to model and visualize battery voltage response.  
- **Action:** Implemented a simple electrical model considering internal resistance and state of charge.  
- **Result:** Created an easy-to-understand plot showing charge and discharge characteristics, useful for battery performance estimation."*
