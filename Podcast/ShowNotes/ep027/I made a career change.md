#### **Cold Open:** *(Background music fades in—energetic but subtle)*  

**Host (Paulin):**  
*"Leaving a stable corporate job is one of the hardest decisions any engineer can make. The fear of uncertainty, financial risks, and the challenge of building something from scratch can be overwhelming.*  

*For years, I was deeply embedded in the aerospace industry, working at companies like Denel and Lilium, where I contributed to cutting-edge flight control systems. But at some point, I realized something was missing.*  

*What if I could use my expertise to help others grow their technical careers? What if I could transition from employee to consultant, coach, and entrepreneur?*  

*Today, I’ll walk you through my journey—from my corporate engineering roots to making the leap into self-employment. If you’re thinking about making a career shift, this episode is for you."*

### **Intro** *(Music intensifies for a second and then fades out into a clean background sound.)*  

**Host (Paulin):**  
*"Welcome to today’s episode of Molomolo African Tech Stories. If you’ve ever felt the tension between staying in a stable job and pursuing something more aligned with your purpose, you’ll relate to my journey. By the end of this episode, you’ll have insights into what it takes to transition from full-time employment to self-employment, the lessons I learned, and the advice I’d give to anyone considering the same path."*

### **Main Section: My Journey to Self-Employment**  

#### **1. The Early Days: Passion for Engineering and Flight Control Systems**  
*(Background music shifts subtly to a more thoughtful, storytelling tone.)*  

**Host (Paulin):**  
*"My engineering career started with a fascination for aerospace technology. From a young age, I was drawn to problem-solving, and my passion for aviation led me to work at Denel, one of South Africa’s premier defense and aerospace companies.*  

*At Denel, I worked on flight control systems—an area that combined control theory, mathematics, and real-world engineering applications. This was a crucial period where I honed my technical skills and gained exposure to high-stakes projects. But at that point, I never thought about doing anything outside of a structured corporate career."*  

*(Pause for reflection.)*  

*"Looking back, I realize that early in our careers, we focus so much on gaining expertise that we don’t consider the bigger picture: Where is this path leading us?"*

#### **2. Transitioning to Lilium: A Shift in Perspective**  
*(Music transitions into a more curious and exploratory tone.)*  

**Host (Paulin):**  
*"After years at Denel, I moved to Lilium, an electric aviation startup in Germany. This was a major shift—not just geographically, but also in terms of company culture and expectations.*  

*Startups move fast. Unlike traditional aerospace firms, where projects can take years, Lilium demanded rapid iteration, adaptability, and strong communication across teams.*  

*It was here that I started realizing the importance of skills beyond technical expertise: collaboration, leadership, and the ability to simplify complex concepts for decision-makers. These skills were just as critical as my engineering knowledge."*  

*(Pause for reflection.)*  

*"Many engineers believe that technical skills alone define their success, but the ability to communicate and adapt is what truly opens doors."*

#### **3. The Desire for Something More: The Turning Point**  
*(Music shifts to a more reflective and personal tone.)*  

**Host (Paulin):**  
*"Even though I was working on groundbreaking technology, I felt a growing urge to do more—not just for myself, but for others. I started mentoring junior engineers, speaking about technical communication, and realizing that my real strength wasn’t just in designing systems, but in helping others navigate their careers.*  

*This was the turning point. I asked myself: What if I could build a business around coaching and consulting? What if I could help engineers improve not just their technical skills, but also their ability to communicate, collaborate, and position themselves for career growth?"*  

*(Pause for reflection.)*  

*"Many people wait for the ‘perfect moment’ to make a change, but often, clarity only comes when you take action."*

#### **4. Making the Leap: The Reality of Self-Employment**  
*(Music transitions into a more problem-solving and strategic tone.)*  

**Host (Paulin):**  
*"The decision to leave corporate life was not easy. It meant giving up financial stability and stepping into the unknown. But I also knew that staying where I was would not fulfill me in the long run.*  

*So, I started building my coaching and consulting practice—Molomolo Tech Studios—while still working. I tested my ideas, engaged with the community, and slowly gained confidence that this could be a sustainable path."*  

*(Pause for reflection.)*  

*"If you’re considering a similar transition, start by testing the waters. Build skills, create content, and engage with potential clients before making the full leap."*

### **Key Lessons for Career Transitions**  

#### **1. Skills Beyond Engineering Matter**  
*"Your ability to communicate, network, and market yourself is just as important as your technical expertise."*  

#### **2. Transitioning Requires a Plan**  
*"Don’t quit without a roadmap. Start building your brand and value proposition while still employed."*  

#### **3. Be Comfortable with Uncertainty**  
*"You’ll never have all the answers before you start. Take calculated risks and adapt along the way."*
