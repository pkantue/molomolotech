#### **Cold Open:** *(Background music fades inâ€”energetic but subtle)*  

**Host (Paulin):**  
*"How do you choose the right career when there are so many options in tech and engineering?*  

Many engineers struggle with deciding between software, embedded systems, control engineering, AI, or even project management. But hereâ€™s the thing: A successful career isnâ€™t just about picking the â€˜rightâ€™ fieldâ€”itâ€™s about understanding how your skills, interests, and mindset align with opportunities.  

Now, imagine youâ€™re in college or early in your career. You love solving technical problems, but youâ€™re unsure whether to go into research, work for a startup, or pursue a corporate engineering role. How do you make that decision?  

Today, weâ€™re unpacking that question with insights from Enrique Maldonado, a Flight Control Laws Engineer at Lilium, the electric aviation company revolutionizing air mobility. His journey holds powerful lessons on how to find clarity in your career path and make intentional choices."*

### **Main Section: HOW to Get There**  

#### **1. What Sparked Your Interest in Engineering?**  
*(Background music shifts subtly to a more thoughtful, storytelling tone.)*  

**Host (Paulin):**  
*"Many engineers struggle to identify their core passion early in their career. Was it an early fascination with aircraft? A love for math and physics? Or maybe an unexpected opportunity that led to a major shift?  

Enrique, can you walk us through the moment when you first realized you wanted to be an engineer? Was there a specific event, mentor, or project that influenced you?"*  

*(Pause for Enrique's response.)*  

**Host (Paulin):**  
*"Thatâ€™s interesting! Many people assume career choices are obvious, but for most of us, they evolve over time. Did you always know you wanted to specialize in Flight Control Laws, or was that something that developed along the way?"*

#### **2. How Did You Decide on Flight Control Laws Over Other Fields?**  
*(Music transitions into a more curious and exploratory tone.)*  

**Host (Paulin):**  
*"Engineering is a vast field, and itâ€™s easy to feel overwhelmed by all the possible pathsâ€”software, systems, control, aerodynamics, AI. How did you narrow down your focus to Flight Control Laws?"*  

*(Pause for Enrique's response.)*  

**Host (Paulin):**  
*"Many early-career engineers struggle with making big career decisions. What advice would you give to someone trying to decide between different fields of engineering?"*

### **ðŸŽ™ INTERLUDE: "Tech Concepts Explainedâ€¦ Badly" ðŸŽ™**  

*(Music shifts to a playful, lighthearted tone. Enter a guest voice, an engineer with a slightly dramatic storytelling style.)*  

**Guest (Engineer):**  
*"Alright folks, todayâ€™s guest technical concept isâ€¦ STABILITY & CONTROL! Ever ridden a bicycle and realized that keeping balance is harder when you're slow? That, my friends, is basic control theory at work.  

Aircraft work the same way. If a plane isn't properly designed for stability, the pilot (or autopilot) has to work way harder to keep it from going out of control.  

In flight control engineering, we donâ€™t just guess at stabilityâ€”we design precise control laws that tell the aircraft how to behave. Think of it like adding training wheels to your bike, but way more advanced!"*  

*(Music fades back to normal episode tone.)*

#### **3. What Skills Were Most Important in Landing Your Role at Lilium?**  
*(Music transitions into a more problem-solving and strategic tone.)*  

**Host (Paulin):**  
*"Many engineers struggle with understanding which skills truly matter when job hunting. When you were preparing for your role at Lilium, what were the most valuable skills that helped you stand out?"*  

*(Pause for Enrique's response.)*  

**Host (Paulin):**  
*"Thereâ€™s always a debate between deep specialization and being a generalist. In your experience, is it better to be a specialist in a niche like Flight Control Laws, or to have a broader set of skills across engineering disciplines?"*  

*(Pause for Enrique's response.)*

#### **4. What Role Did Networking & Internships Play in Your Career?**  
*(Music transitions to a more engaging and personal reflection tone.)*  

**Host (Paulin):**  
*"Many engineers focus only on technical skills, but career growth often depends on networking, mentorship, and gaining real-world experience. How did internships, networking, or mentors help shape your career path?"*  

*(Pause for Enrique's response.)*  

**Host (Paulin):**  
*"For those who might not have strong industry connections, whatâ€™s the best way to build a professional network and find mentors?"*  

*(Pause for Enrique's response.)*

### **5. How Do You Handle Career Uncertainty & Growth?**  
*(Music transitions to a more reflective and inspirational tone.)*  

**Host (Paulin):**  
*"Even after landing a great role, career growth comes with challengesâ€”learning curves, imposter syndrome, career pivots. Have you ever faced moments of uncertainty, and how did you navigate them?"*  

*(Pause for Enrique's response.)*  

**Host (Paulin):**  
*"If you could give one piece of career advice to your younger self, what would it be?"*
