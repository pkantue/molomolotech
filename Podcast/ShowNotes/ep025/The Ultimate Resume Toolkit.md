### **Main Section: HOW to Build an Amazing Resume**  

#### **1. MS Word – The Classic Powerhouse**  
*(Background shifts to a productive, upbeat tone.)*  

**Host (Paulin):**  
*"Let’s start with the most widely used tool—**Microsoft Word**. It’s simple, accessible, and powerful if used correctly. But here’s the mistake most people make: they treat it like a blank sheet instead of a structured document.  

Rebecca Enonchong understood the power of structure early in her career. She wasn’t just another tech founder—she positioned herself as a specialist in **enterprise software solutions**, and every professional document she created reinforced that.  

So, when using MS Word:  
- Use **clear headings** (Education, Experience, Skills).  
- Keep bullet points short—**action + result** (e.g., “Developed a cloud system that reduced downtime by 30%”).  
- **Stick to clean fonts** (Calibri, Arial, Times New Roman).  

Your resume should be as structured as **an engineering project plan**—concise, organized, and effective."*

#### **2. MS PowerPoint – The Unexpected Resume Booster**  
*(Music shifts slightly to a ‘secret hack’ tone.)*  

**Host (Paulin):**  
*"Now, this one surprises people—**PowerPoint for resumes?** Yes! If you need a **visually compelling** resume, PowerPoint lets you arrange content in a structured yet creative way.  

Rebecca Enonchong often speaks about the importance of presenting complex ideas in a digestible format. If you’re applying for a **design-heavy** role (UI/UX, marketing, or product management), try PowerPoint to create a one-page, infographic-style resume.  

Here’s how:  
- **Use slides as sections** (Header, Experience, Projects, Skills).  
- Keep **visual hierarchy** clear—important info stands out.  
- Export as **PDF** for easy sharing."*

#### **🎙 INTERLUDE: "Tech Concepts Explained… Badly" 🎙**  
*(Music shifts to a playful, lighthearted tone.)*  

**Guest (Engineer):**  
*"Today’s tech concept is… BUFFER OVERFLOW! You know when you’re serving rice, and you keep piling it on until it spills off the plate? That’s **buffer overflow** in computing—when a program writes too much data to a memory space, causing errors or security vulnerabilities.  

And in resumes? That’s when you overload your CV with **way too much information**. If you’ve got 10 pages of details about every project since high school… congrats, you’ve just crashed the recruiter’s brain!"*  

*(Music fades back to normal episode tone.)*

#### **3. Canva – The Designer’s Secret Weapon**  
*(Music transitions into a dynamic, creative vibe.)*  

**Host (Paulin):**  
*"If you want a **polished, professional-looking resume** without being a graphic designer, **Canva** is your best friend.  

Rebecca Enonchong built a brand that stood out in the male-dominated tech industry, and **branding matters for your resume too**. Canva helps you create a **visually appealing, well-structured resume** that aligns with your personal brand.

- Use **pre-made resume templates**—they’re professional and ATS-friendly.
