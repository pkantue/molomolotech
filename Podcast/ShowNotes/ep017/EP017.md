   - **Wangari Maathai** (1940–2011) was a Kenyan environmentalist, political activist, and the first African woman to win the **Nobel Peace Prize** (2004). She is best known for founding the **Green Belt Movement** in 1977, which focused on tree planting, environmental conservation, and women's rights. Maathai’s movement encouraged rural women to plant trees to combat deforestation, soil erosion, and water scarcity, simultaneously empowering them by providing jobs and improving their livelihoods.

Her environmental efforts were met with political opposition, especially from Kenya's government under President Daniel arap Moi. Maathai's activism highlighted the government's role in environmental degradation, often linked to land grabs and corruption. She faced intimidation, arrests, and violent confrontations, including during her successful campaign to stop the construction of a skyscraper in Nairobi’s **Uhuru Park** in the late 1980s.

Despite these challenges, Maathai’s perseverance transformed the Green Belt Movement into a global force, with over 51 million trees planted.
