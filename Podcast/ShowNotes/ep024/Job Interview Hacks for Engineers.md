#### **Cold Open:** *(Background music fades inâ€”energetic but subtle)*  

**Host (Paulin):**  
*"Did you know that only about 20% of engineers make it past the first round of job interviews due to poor communication of their technical skills?*  

One mistake engineers make is assuming that technical expertise alone is enough. But hereâ€™s the reality: Employers are not just hiring coders, designers, or system architects. Theyâ€™re hiring problem-solvers who can articulate their solutions clearly.  

Now, imagine you're competing for a role at a top tech company. Youâ€™re brilliant, your resume is impressive, but when they ask you to explain a project you worked on, you stumble. You ramble. You lose them. And just like that, youâ€™ve lost the opportunity.  

But what if you could be in the 80% who stand out and land the job? Today, weâ€™re going to fix that."*

### **Intro** *(Music intensifies for a second and then fades out into a clean background sound.)*  

**Host (Paulin):**  
*"Welcome to todayâ€™s episode of Molomolo African Tech Stories. If youâ€™ve ever struggled with job interviews, this is for you. By the end of this episode, youâ€™ll have the key strategies to confidently communicate your engineering skills and secure your dream job. No more nervous stumbles; just clarity, impact, and a winning mindset.  

And to make this even more powerful, weâ€™ll learn from the story of Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, the Nigerian entrepreneur who went from rejected job applications to co-founding Andela and Flutterwaveâ€”two companies that revolutionized Africaâ€™s tech ecosystem. His journey holds powerful lessons that apply directly to how you should approach your next engineering interview."*

### **Main Section: HOW to Get There**  

#### **1. Be Hungry to Learn, But Eat with a Fork and Knife**  
*(Background music shifts subtly to a more thoughtful, storytelling tone.)*  

**Host (Paulin):**  
*"Most engineers are eager to learn. Thatâ€™s great. But eagerness without strategy is like eating with your hands at a fancy dinner. Itâ€™s messy. Instead, picture yourself at a tableâ€”youâ€™re hungry, but you use a fork and knife. Precision and structure. Thatâ€™s how you should approach learning and presenting your skills in an interview.*  

Now, letâ€™s talk about Iyinoluwa Aboyeji. Before he built Flutterwave, a billion-dollar company that powers payments across Africa, he faced rejection. He applied to jobs. He got turned down. Instead of randomly picking up skills, he asked himself, â€˜What is the one thing I can master that will make me valuable?â€™  

For him, it was understanding how technology solves real-world business problems. He focused on that, and within a few years, he wasnâ€™t asking for jobs anymoreâ€”he was creating them.  

So, in your interview, donâ€™t just say, â€˜I know Python, MATLAB, and Simulink.â€™ Instead, frame your learning:  

â€˜Recently, I optimized a MATLAB script for processing real-time sensor data. By switching from loops to vectorized operations, I reduced processing time by 40%.â€™  

See the difference? You're showing structured learning and impact. Hungry to learn, but eating with precision."*

### **ðŸŽ™ INTERLUDE: "Tech Concepts Explainedâ€¦ Badly" ðŸŽ™**  

*(Music shifts to a playful, lighthearted tone. Enter a guest voice, an engineer with a slightly dramatic storytelling style.)*  

**Guest (Engineer):**  
*"Alright folks, todayâ€™s guest technical concept isâ€¦ DEADLOCKS! Ever been in traffic where four cars reach an intersection at the same time, and everyone is just staring at each other? â€˜You go!â€™ â€˜No, you go!â€™ And no one moves? That, my friends, is a DEADLOCK in computing.  

Basically, when multiple processes are waiting for each other to finish, but none can proceed, everything gets stuck.  

In an interview, if they ask you about deadlocks, donâ€™t panic. Just say: â€˜Itâ€™s like four aunties arguing over who should serve the jollof rice first. Until someone backs down, dinner ainâ€™t happening.â€™  

And if they ask how to fix it? Simple: â€˜You set priorities or timeoutsâ€”just like how in real life, the hungriest person usually makes the first move!â€™"*  

*(Music fades back to normal episode tone.)*

#### **2. Structure Your Answers with STAR**  
*(Music transitions into a more energetic, problem-solving vibe.)*  

**Host (Paulin):**  
*"One of the biggest mistakes engineers make in interviews is rambling. Youâ€™re asked a question, and before you know it, youâ€™re diving into the history of control systems from 1920.  

Letâ€™s fix that with the STAR method:  
- **Situation** â€“ What was the problem?  
- **Task** â€“ What was your role?  
- **Action** â€“ What did you do?  
- **Result** â€“ What was the outcome?  

Now, letâ€™s bring in Aboyeji again. When he co-founded Andela, the mission was clear: How do we train world-class African software engineers? His approach followed STAR naturally.  

- **Situation** â€“ Africa had massive untapped tech talent.  
- **Task** â€“ His role was to create a scalable training system.  
- **Action** â€“ He built a learning model combining mentorship with real-world projects.  
- **Result** â€“ Andela grew into a global company, training thousands of engineers.  

Your interviews should follow the same logic."*  

### **Why the Africa Tech Summit Can Boost Your Career**

**Host (Paulin):**
*"Before we move to the next key strategy, letâ€™s talk about something that could be a game-changer for your job huntâ€”the Africa Tech Summit happening this February in Nairobi, Kenya from 12 & 13 Feb. 2025

This event is not just a conferenceâ€”itâ€™s where Africaâ€™s leading tech founders, investors, and hiring managers gather. And if youâ€™re looking to land a job or grow your network, this is the place to be.

Why does this matter for your job interviews?

Youâ€™ll hear directly from industry leaders about the most in-demand skills.
You can connect with recruiters who are actively hiring.
Youâ€™ll gain insight into emerging trends that you can reference in interviews to sound like an industry insider.
Imagine ending an interview with:
â€˜At the Africa Tech Summit, I learned about the shift towards AI-driven embedded systems and how companies are integrating MATLAB for rapid prototyping.â€™

That instantly makes you sound knowledgeable and engaged with industry trends.

So, if you can attend, do it. And if you canâ€™t, follow the event online and absorb as much information as possible."*

#### **3. Ask Questions That Make You Unforgettable**  

**Host (Paulin):**  
*"A great interview isnâ€™t just about answering questions wellâ€”itâ€™s also about asking great questions. If you donâ€™t ask thoughtful questions, you blend into the background.  

Iyinoluwa Aboyeji was known for challenging assumptions. Instead of simply looking at problems, he asked, â€˜How can we scale African tech talent globally?â€™ That question led to Andela.  

Now, imagine youâ€™re in an interview. Instead of just asking, â€˜Whatâ€™s the company culture like?â€™ try:  

â€˜Whatâ€™s a technical challenge your team is currently facing that I could contribute to solving?â€™  

Or,  

â€˜I noticed your company is expanding into embedded systems. How do you see MATLAB being integrated into that workflow?â€™  

These questions show you think like an insider. They make you memorable. And most importantly, they make interviewers see you as a problem-solver, not just a job seeker."*

### **MATLAB Practice: Debugging & Optimization for Interview Readiness**  
*(Background music fades out slightly for a hands-on practice moment.)*  

**Host (Paulin):**  
*"Now, letâ€™s get practical. A common interview question for engineers is: â€˜How would you optimize code efficiency?â€™  

Hereâ€™s a simple MATLAB exercise:  

```matlab
% Sample MATLAB Code to Optimize
function optimizedCalculation    
    n = 1e6;
    data = rand(n,1);

    tic  % Start timer
    % Initial slow method
    sum1 = 0;
    for i = 1:n
        sum1 = sum1 + data(i);
    end
    toc  % Stop timer

    tic  % Start timer
    % Optimized method using built-in functions
    sum2 = sum(data);
    toc  % Stop timer

    fprintf('Loop sum: %f\n', sum1);
    fprintf('Vectorized sum: %f\n', sum2);
    
end


% Elapsed time is 0.397462 seconds.
% Elapsed time is 0.063813 seconds.
% Loop sum: 500321.249925
% Vectorized sum: 500321.249925
```

Run this in MATLAB, and note how much faster the vectorized method is compared to the loop-based approach."*
