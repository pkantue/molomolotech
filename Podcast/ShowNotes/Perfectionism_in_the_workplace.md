# Why Perfectionism Is Killing Your Career (and How to break free)
## Hook: Are you someone who is often trapped or exhausted by your belief that failure is not an option (i.e army sergeant speech to cadets). Do you often feel indecisive amid "too much risk" or "too little information"?

## Intro
### As part of our series on Impostor syndrome, we will start with Perfectionism. We will make use of some self-reflective questions to reveal our perfectionist nature through the story of a famous African technologist and revolutionary, Thomas Sankara, who I believe was also a perfectionist. 
### We will also discuss some strategies to start breaking away for our perfectinist nature.

## Questions:
1. **What are your core beliefs about success and failure?**  
   (This helps identify if perfectionism stems from fear of failure or societal expectations.)
   
2. **Do you associate your self-worth with your achievements?**
   (Understanding if someone equates their value with productivity or outcomes can highlight deeper issues.)
   
3. **What is your reaction when you donâ€™t meet your own high standards?**  
   (This explores emotional responses and the intensity of self-criticism.)

4. **How do you approach collaboration and delegation in your work?**  
   (This examines whether perfectionism inhibits teamwork and trust.)

## story of Thomas Sankara
- Known for his dedication to anti-corruption, self-sufficiency, and radical reforms.
- Sankara tirelessly worked to reshape Burkina Faso into a model of African independence.
- While he introduced progressive reforms such as health campaigns, land redistribution, and gender equality initiatives, his use of Popular Revolutionary Tribunals (PRTs) and the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDRs) became a point of concern?
### - Who was concerned with this? The west, of course.
- But the fact remains: These tribunals prosecuted those considered enemies of the revolution, including public officials accused of corruption, political crimes, and counter-revolutionary activities.
- Thomas strive for perfection resulted in an oppressive and authoritarian state.
#### - Some may say, what's the problem with that? Change by ANY means!

## What is Perfectionism
It is the fear of inadequacy disguised as the pursuit for excellence. 
### Left unchecked, it forms of complex network of destructive thoughts, imbalanced lifestyle, and poor relationships with the pretext of suffering for the greater "good". 

### Sankara's life answer to Q1
- "True success is empowering the people and achieving independence from foreign control. Failure is accepting exploitation. We must strive for progress, even at personal cost."
### Sankara's life answer to Q2
- "My worth lies in the impact I make for my people, not in titles or accolades. Achievement is meaningful only if it uplifts society." 
### Sankara's life answer to Q3
- "Disappointment fuels reflection." Sankara would respond with intensified efforts, potentially resorting to more authoritarian measures to meet his goals."
### Sankara's life answer to Q4
- Sankara had a strong vision and, while he valued teamwork, his perfectionist nature made delegation difficult. He often maintained strict control over decision-making.

### Strategies to overcome:
- **Understand where perfectionist nature comes from** The fear of others (including your own thoughts).
- **Set realistic goals for an unrealistic vision:** Break tasks into smaller, achievable milestones to avoid overwhelming pressure.
- **Celebrate progress (yours and others)** Focus on growth rather than flawless results.
- **Embrace failure:** View mistakes as learning opportunities, not reflections of competence.
- **Practice delegation:** Trust others and acknowledge that imperfection is part of collaboration.
