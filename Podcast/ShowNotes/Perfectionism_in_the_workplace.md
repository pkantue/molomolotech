I've learned over the years to ask myself a couple of questions to 

### Questions:
1. **What are your core beliefs about success and failure?**  
   (This helps identify if perfectionism stems from fear of failure or societal expectations.)
   
2. **Do you associate your self-worth with your achievements?**
   (Understanding if someone equates their value with productivity or outcomes can highlight deeper issues.)
   
3. **What is your reaction when you donâ€™t meet your own high standards?**  
   (This explores emotional responses and the intensity of self-criticism.)

4. **How do you approach collaboration and delegation in your work?**  
   (This examines whether perfectionism inhibits teamwork and trust.)

### Strategies:
- **Set realistic goals:** Break tasks into smaller, achievable milestones to avoid overwhelming pressure.
- **Celebrate progress (yours and others)** Focus on growth rather than flawless results.
- **Embrace failure:** View mistakes as learning opportunities, not reflections of competence.
- **Practice delegation:** Trust others and acknowledge that imperfection is part of collaboration.
