**Title: 5 Workplace Habits That Make You An Impostor (African Folktale)**

 From the (website)[https://www.therapywithabby.co.uk/blog/5-types-of-imposter-syndrome], this article  
 
The characters from "The Secret Lives of Baba Segi's Wives" can be linked to common habits of employees in the workplace through their manifestations of impostor syndrome:

1. **Iya Segi (The Perfectionist)**: An employee who sets extremely high standards and feels stressed when they fall short, often struggling to delegate tasks due to a belief that others can't meet their standards.
2. **Iya Tope (The Superwoman)**: An employee who takes on excessive work to prove their capability, leading to burnout from trying to excel in every role.
3. **Iya Femi (The Expert)**: An employee who constantly seeks additional knowledge and feels unqualified despite their competence, fearing being exposed as a fraud.
4. **Bolanle (The Soloist)**: An employee who prefers to work alone, avoiding asking for help to not reveal perceived inadequacies, which can isolate them from team collaboration.
5. **Bolanle (The Natural Genius)**: An employee who expects tasks to be easy and feels inadequate when facing challenges, interpreting difficulty as a lack of ability rather than a normal learning process.

These behaviours reflect how impostor syndrome can affect workplace performance, teamwork, and well-being in the workplace.
