 From the (website)[https://www.therapywithabby.co.uk/blog/5-types-of-imposter-syndrome], that describes the different aspects of impostor syndrome. 
 
The characters from "The Secret Lives of Baba Segi's Wives" can be linked to common habits of employees in the workplace through their manifestations of impostor syndrome:

### Iya Segi (The Perfectionist)

Iya Segi, the first wife in "The Secret Lives of Baba Segi's Wives," embodies the perfectionist type of impostor syndrome. As the senior wife, she feels immense pressure to maintain her status and be the perfect matriarch. She meticulously manages the household and ensures that everything runs smoothly. Despite her outward confidence and control, Iya Segi is plagued by a fear of failure and a deep-seated need to prove her worth. Her relentless pursuit of perfection often leads to stress and an inability to delegate tasks, as she believes no one else can meet her high standards. This constant striving for flawlessness causes her to overlook her own achievements, focusing instead on minor imperfections and perceived shortcomings.

### Iya Tope (The Superwoman)

Iya Tope, the second wife, represents the superwoman type of impostor syndrome. She feels compelled to excel in every role she undertakes, juggling her responsibilities as a wife, mother, and member of the household. Iya Tope’s need to prove her capability leads her to overcommit and take on more than she can handle. Despite her diligent efforts, she often feels like she is not doing enough, fearing that others might view her as inadequate. This relentless drive to meet and exceed expectations leaves her exhausted and stressed, as she struggles to balance her multiple roles. Iya Tope’s internal battle with her sense of inadequacy highlights the pressure many women face to perform flawlessly in all aspects of their lives.

### Iya Femi (The Expert)

Iya Femi, the third wife, epitomizes the expert type of impostor syndrome. Despite her extensive knowledge and skills, she constantly feels unqualified and fears being exposed as a fraud. Iya Femi believes she must know everything before she can consider herself competent, leading her to continually seek more information and validation. Her insecurity manifests in her interactions with others, where she feels the need to prove her expertise repeatedly. This relentless quest for perfection hinders her ability to appreciate her own accomplishments and accept that she is already highly capable. Iya Femi’s journey reflects the struggles of individuals who are never satisfied with their knowledge and are constantly seeking external validation.

### Bolanle (The Soloist and The Natural Genius)

Bolanle, the fourth wife, represents both the soloist and the natural genius types of impostor syndrome. As a soloist, she feels the need to handle everything independently and is reluctant to seek help, believing that doing so would expose her perceived inadequacies. Bolanle’s educational background and intellectual prowess also make her a natural genius. She expects tasks to come easily and struggles when faced with challenges, interpreting difficulties as a sign of incompetence. Bolanle’s isolation is fueled by her shame and fear of being judged, leading her to withdraw from the other wives and internalize her struggles. Her dual battle with impostor syndrome types highlights the complexity of self-doubt and the multifaceted nature of impostor feelings. Bolanle’s character arc illustrates the internal conflict of highly capable individuals who feel unworthy of their achievements and isolate themselves due to their fear of inadequacy.
