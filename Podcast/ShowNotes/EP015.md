This is the following idea on **8 Common Habits that Keep Africans Poor**

**Outline**
Recently, I spoke to a close relative who I hadn't spoken to in a long time. He's a well-sought-after professional living in Europe and managed to grow in his career continuously. And yet, like most Africans, he consistently struggles with his finances, mainly driven by the burden of providing for the constant needs of his family back in his home country. But as I asked more questions, I realised that the situation was more complex than purely blaming our stagnant finances on the so-called 'black tax'. 

Perhaps you are the same or know someone in the same situation. Well in today's video, we're talking about 8 habits that keep a lot of Africans poor, even for established professionals and entrepreneurs. This is Molomolo African Tech Stories.
