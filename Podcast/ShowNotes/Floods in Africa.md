- Every year, over a period of 3 months, over 20% of Nigeria's food-producing farmland gets flooded and its farmers workers and millions of people face a food crisis to the point of starvation. Every. Single. Year!
- Considering how lucrative farm produce is, why aren't tech companies targeting such areas that are in dire need of solutions?
- This is the first episode of the Molomolo AfroTech Chronicles, where we give our opinion on trending news that are affecting the daily lives of Africans with the hope that we can create a safe space to discuss these issues and work together to find solutions.

I'm Dr Paulin Kantue, Let's go!

# Introduction
This week news outlets sounded the alarm on the Sahel region and neighboring areas on the risk of floods due to high rainfall, eroding large areas of farmland across the African continent

# Problem/Challenge

## The risk on health and sanitation
- The threat of disease outbreaks is elevated during the rainy season. 
- Backflow from drains that has mixed with floodwaters can become trapped in open areas when inundations recede.
- These stagnant pools often become a breeding ground for mosquitoes and bacteria, increasing the incidence of insect- and waterborne diseases.
- Exposure to contaminated water from inundated industrial sites, sewer systems, and septic tanks also poses a significant health threat.

Outline the central challenge of recurring floods in Africa, emphasizing how they devastate communities and lead to widespread hunger.

# Exploration/Development
## Output Research 

Explore the causes of these floods, including climate change and deforestation, and discuss their effects on agriculture and local economies.

# Climax/Key Moment
The feedback loop on the impact of floods on the poverty line of most of the affected regions can be developed. This will be the subject of our next LIVE session where we will go deeper into this subject. 


# Conclusion/Summary
- What is the solution for such regions?
- How can Tech help in alleviation the pressure on the poverty line and begin to show a positive trend in the resilience against extreme conditions? 

Summarize the critical points discussed, reiterating the importance of addressing the cycle of floods and starvation in Africa.
