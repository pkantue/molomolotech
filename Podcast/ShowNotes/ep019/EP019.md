- I love dogs.
- I have two miniature schnauzers and I adore them.
- That's Asterix and Obelix.
- Unfortunately, we lost my eldest dog, Asterix due to illness a couple of days.
- He was 13 years old.
- The last 4-6 months were really tough...
- we had to deal with treatment after treatment, jaw amputation, settling of arthritis and even loss of hearing.
- Our house had become a pet hospital.
- But during that time, I learned and grew in my mental strength.
- The strength required to deal with hardships, setbacks and personal loss.
- I learnt that such strength can be shaped and moulded.
- Only through hard times.
- But why is that?

### Resilience in Adversity

- Highlight how colleagues are working harder than before.

### Emotional Strength in Support Systems

Just as dogs provide unwavering emotional support, successful innovators lean on strong networks of mentors, peers, and communities to maintain their mental strength.

### Purpose Through Reflection

Personal loss often leads to deep reflection on priorities and goals, much like the introspection that drives African tech leaders to create meaningful solutions.

### Mental Health as a Foundation

The companionship of a pet highlights the importance of emotional well-being, which is equally vital for sustaining the mental fortitude needed in high-pressure entrepreneurial journeys.

### Dedication and Inner Strength
