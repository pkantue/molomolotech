(0:00) Have you ever struggled to explain a complex idea to someone who isn't an expert? (0:05) Whether it's describing how AI works, explaining a technical concept to your boss, (0:09) or even teaching your kids how airplanes stay in the air. (0:13) Breaking down complexity is a valuable skill. (0:17) Today we are using flight control concepts, yay, to teach you step-by-step strategies (0:23) for simplifying complicated topics.
(0:26) If an aircraft stays balanced at 30,000 feet using well-designed control laws, (0:31) you can definitely learn how to structure your explanation for clarity and impact. (0:37) By the end of this episode, you'll have a framework to reunicate (0:41) even the most intricate ideas in a way that anyone can understand. (0:49) Hello and welcome to Molo Molo, another episode of African Tech Stories.
(0:53) If you've ever felt frustrated trying to explain technical ideas to non-experts, (0:58) this episode is for you. (1:00) Today, we're breaking down effective communication using flight control engineering concepts, (1:06) because if you can control an aircraft moving in the sky, (1:10) six degrees of freedom, we can definitely control how we explain complex ideas. (1:16) So, we're going to take this step-by-step in terms of strategies (1:19) on how we can indeed simplify complex ideas for the layman.
(1:25) Number one, we need to start with the big picture. (1:28) So, let's take this into consideration. (1:32) Let's take an aircraft in flight.
(1:34) Before explaining stability, actuators, control loops, inner loop, outer loop, (1:40) what's the most important thing? (1:42) What's the big picture? (1:44) An airplane flies because of four main forces. (1:49) Lift, weight, thrust, and drag. (1:54) Now, we can go into much more details, (1:57) but it's those four that fundamentally hold every single airplane in the air (2:02) or in a specific maneuver.
(2:04) When explaining complex ideas, always start with the big picture. (2:10) What's the main purpose? (2:11) What problem does it solve? (2:14) Why should your listener, you, care? (2:18) If you're explaining a technical system, (2:20) start with what it does before diving in how it works. (2:24) So, number two, use analogies relating to everyday life.
(2:29) I love this one. (2:31) Now, control laws in aviation might sound complicated, right? (2:35) We talk about, I can go on and on for hours on end, (2:38) and those who are watching this podcast might appreciate (2:41) the fact that I've used control laws to try and explain (2:45) how to explain complicated topics in simple ways. (2:50) But control laws in general is a very interesting but overly complicated idea.
(2:56) But at the core, they work just like, for example, riding a bicycle. (3:01) When you steer the bike, you make small adjustments to maintain balance. (3:05) If you overcorrect, you might fall.
(3:08) If you undercorrect, you might drift, of course. (3:12) So, similarly, an aircraft control laws adjust the surfaces, (3:17) called ailerons, which are used to bank the aircraft, (3:21) or rather, used to steer the aircraft's nose to maintain stability and direction. (3:28) So, when explaining a technical concept, (3:31) find an everyday analogy that makes it relatable.
(3:35) The self-driving car's control system. (3:38) Think of it like cruise control, but with a smarter system that steers for you. (3:44) That's it.
(3:45) Number three. (3:48) Breaking it down into simple steps. (3:51) Now, imagine teaching someone how a flight control system stabilizes an aircraft.
(3:58) I remember the first time, and I can tell a story, (4:01) in my third year at the University of Zwartesrand in Johannesburg, (4:07) we had a course called Flight Dynamics. (4:11) Oh, man. (4:12) Was it crucial to understand and to really grasp the concept of how an aircraft actually works.
(4:21) And it went into deep maths. (4:23) And the reason why it's in third year, because it takes into account maths of second year, (4:28) takes into account dynamics of second year, (4:31) takes into account all sorts of subjects that are relevant for you to learn how an aircraft flies. (4:40) Now, instead of dumping all the information at once, we've got to break it down step by step.
(4:47) Why? (4:48) Because it's complicated. (4:50) And complicated things can get out of hand, even in our own minds. (4:54) So, what's the goal? (4:55) Keep the aircraft stable and on course, for example.
(4:59) Which means it needs to be flying straight and level. (5:02) What does it mean? (5:03) It means you shouldn't be dipping in altitude, right? (5:05) Essentially, if you were sitting in an aircraft, (5:07) you shouldn't be feeling that you are descending or rising. (5:12) Now, what's needed? (5:14) Let's just say we need some sensors to measure movement, and computers to process the data, (5:20) and eventually actuators, which means just control surfaces on the aircraft (5:25) to adjust the different positions.
(5:31) So, how does this work? (5:33) The system detects, for example, any deviation and applies the right correction, (5:38) just like a driver adjusts the steering wheel on a highway, (5:43) as soon as he sees a bump on the road or a hole on the ground. (5:48) This step-by-step approach is called progressive disclosure. (5:51) You reveal information in layers, (5:54) making sure your audience understands each layer before you move on to the next.
(6:00) Now, if you take that into account, (6:03) you can break down, for example, something called longitudinal dynamics (6:07) and lateral dynamics of an aircraft into a very similar process, (6:12) where you start with what is needed, (6:15) and you go into how we're going to get what we need, (6:19) and explain the details of what we've used to get what we needed. (6:25) Simple enough. (6:27) Number four, use visual and physical demonstrations.
(6:31) Now, have you seen a pilot use a model airplane to explain aerodynamics? (6:38) Yeah, I have and I use it all the time with my nine-year-old. (6:42) That's because visuals and physical objects make learning easier. (6:48) If you're explaining stability, take a paper airplane, right? (6:53) Everybody knows what a paper airplane looks like, (6:55) and show how different wing angles affect flight.
(6:59) So what does that mean? (7:00) It means if you have a paper airplane where it's nice and slim and slender, (7:06) what will happen is you will not always get a very (7:10) beautiful set of flight. (7:11) Why? Because you need to go really fast. (7:13) Now, if you make the wings, each wing of the paper airplane a lot larger, (7:19) what you will immediately notice is that the flight is a lot more slower, (7:25) and a lot more beautiful, (7:26) and the rate at which the airplane goes down to the ground is a lot more slower.
(7:32) That explains something called aspect ratio, (7:35) which for some people, even in my own experience, (7:41) still is something that is tough to grasp. (7:44) See, in everyday tech explanations, visuals help, right? (7:50) Instead of describing a software process with words alone, (7:54) use things like flowcharts and sketches. (7:57) Use programs like MatchChart or Overleaf or Google Docs and Google Draw, (8:05) because when you do that, or even hand gestures, you know, (8:09) using hands, or just, just go onto a board (8:13) to clarify relationships between components and systems.
(8:18) So visualization helps. (8:22) Number five, connect to the real world applications. (8:27) So now imagine you're explaining an autopilot system.
(8:31) Ooh, what is an autopilot? (8:33) You might probably think an autopilot is a pilot that is on Autodrive. (8:40) Maybe. (8:41) Now, instead of speaking about complex algorithms, (8:45) connect it to something more practical, for example.
(8:48) Now, for example, have you used Google Maps, (8:53) which has a turn-by-turn navigation? (8:57) Autopilot works in the same way, right? (8:59) Remember that blue arrow that, or whatever the color may be on your phone, (9:05) that gives you a sense of where you should be turning? (9:08) That's exactly how autopilot works. (9:10) So instead, but instead, it's steering for you, right? (9:14) So it's doing, it's showing you where it's going, and it's doing the action. (9:19) So the aircraft follows a program route using the sensors (9:23) and everything else around its environment to make a decision (9:26) and automate the movement.
(9:30) See, relating technical concepts to familiar experiences (9:34) makes them more digestible and memorable. (9:38) So having said that, now let's go into something quite interesting. (9:42) We have a bit of an interlude and a bit of a light-hearted one.
(9:46) So let's try and see. (9:49) We've got a technical concept called feedback loops. (9:52) Do you know what a feedback loop is? (9:55) Let's just see if we can think about it.
(9:57) And there we go. (9:59) Have you thought about it? (10:00) Okay, great. (10:01) Now, let me give you one good example.
(10:04) Have you ever baked cookies? (10:06) I love cookies, especially my wife's cookies. (10:09) And checked the oven too many times, you know, making them collapse. (10:15) So i.e. you've opened the ovens in and out and in and out and in and out, (10:19) because you don't really trust that you're doing the right thing.
(10:22) But at the end of the day, they collapse. (10:25) i.e. they were not hot enough. (10:28) That's a very poor feedback loop.
(10:32) In flight control, feedback loops adjust inputs based on real-time data. (10:38) So if the airplane tilts or banks too much, (10:42) sensors will detect it and the system will correct it to straighten level, for example. (10:48) Just like adjusting your oven temperature if cookies are baking too fast.
(10:53) Very important concept. (10:56) An airplane autopilot and feedback loop is just like you opening the oven too many times, (11:03) causing the cookies not to bake as well. (11:07) So, effective communication is a superpower.
(11:11) Yep, I've said it. (11:13) Whether you're an engineer, a researcher, or entrepreneur. (11:18) Today we covered key techniques, right? (11:21) Starting with the big picture.
(11:23) Think of the big picture. (11:25) Using analogies, breaking concepts into steps, (11:29) leveraging visuals and connecting to the real world and applications. (11:34) Now, I've got a surprise.
(11:37) I recently finished a book. (11:40) Yay! (11:41) To me, it's an ebook that you can get for free. (11:45) I've made it available for all those who are interested in giving me feedback.
(11:49) So you just, there will be a link with this podcast or this video (11:53) where you can essentially grab a copy. (11:56) Just leave your email and you can definitely download the ebook. (12:00) It's essentially a story about a guy who goes through a maze (12:04) and he struggles with self-doubt and confidence and be able to speak up, (12:08) you know, technical communication and complex ideas (12:12) and goes and meets up with some characters that will allow him to deal with those things.
(12:17) But also at the end of the day, give him a very big surprise (12:23) about where do those characters actually come from. (12:27) So I'm not going to spoil it. (12:29) Pick up the book.
(12:30) The book is called, Please Do Not Let Me Be Invisible. (12:34) I think that's the title now. (12:37) So definitely, I'm very excited about it.
(12:39) Very excited about what you think. (12:41) And again, thank you so much for the support (12:43) for all those who have been supporting Molo Molo Tech Studios up to this point. (12:48) So now we've talked about breaking down complex ideas.
(12:52) So if you want to improve how you explain technical ideas, (12:57) whether for job interviews, presentations, or even team discussions, (13:02) I offer a one-on-one coaching at Molo Molo Tech Studios to help you. (13:06) So we sharpen your technical storytelling skills to engage a different audience. (13:12) We simplify simple ideas, complex ideas through without losing depth.
(13:18) So we really go into a very pragmatic approach where we try and prioritize. (13:23) We try and give a sense of collaboration. (13:27) And but more importantly, we open up the need to be clear and concise.
(13:31) We also go through very strong and develop strong visuals and demonstration (13:36) to reinforce specific learning points where we also leverage your strong point, (13:41) which sometimes is so crucial. (13:44) So this all boils down to you growing and speaking with clarity and confidence (13:51) in every professional settings. (13:53) So again, if you're interested, click in the description below.
(13:57) For a free strategy session, we'll go through a technical assessment. (14:01) And you will be able to start leveling up your communication skills (14:05) as I walk you along right through it. (14:07) So in recap, start with the big picture.
(14:12) Define the why before the how. (14:16) Use analogies. (14:17) Relate new ideas to familiar experiences.
(14:20) Break it down into steps. (14:22) Unpack complexity progressively. (14:26) Leverage visuals and thought processes that can be easily explained and demonstrations.
(14:32) Seeing is understanding, specifically for those who are non-technical. (14:37) Connect to real world applications, right? (14:40) Make it practical and relevant. (14:43) Master these techniques and I promise you, (14:45) you'll make complex ideas not even simple, but engaging and memorable.
