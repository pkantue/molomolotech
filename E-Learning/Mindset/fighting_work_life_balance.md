### **Why People Struggle with Work-Life Balance**  
- **Blurred Boundaries** – Work and personal life blend too much (remote work, notifications, always online).  
- **Core Values Get Neglected** – People lose sight of what truly matters (family, health, passion projects).  
- **The Productivity Trap** – Always chasing efficiency but never feeling “done.”  
- **External Pressures** – Societal expectations, job demands, financial stress.
- **The Bargaining Dilemma** – Choosing between career, relationships, personal growth, and health feels like a lose-lose game.  

### **How to Achieve Better Balance**  
1. **Set Boundaries** – Define work hours, limit distractions, create “off” time.  
2. **Know Your Core Values** – Identify what truly matters and defend it.  
3. **The Art of Bargaining** – Allocate time intentionally; balance isn’t perfect, but it can be *enough*.  
4. **Micro-Wins** – Small, meaningful habits (e.g., daily 10-min check-ins with family, short workouts).  
5. **Recalibrate Regularly** – Adjust priorities as life evolves.
