Hi I'm Dr. Paulin Kantue and welcome to my GitHub page. I'm an aerospace engineer with over 17 years of experience and I've created Molomolo Tech Studios to help you reach your full potential molo molo (step by step) through technology.

Let’s start with Technical Skills & Proficiency. This is all about knowing your core skills. Make sure you review the essential tools and technologies for the role and prepare to discuss your specific problem-solving experiences. Updating yourself on recent trends can also show interviewers that you’re staying current in your field.

Next is Problem-Solving & Technical Communication. Communication matters as much as the solution itself, so practice explaining complex ideas in simple terms. Be ready to walk through your thought process on hypothetical problems—this shows your logical approach and how well you can work under pressure.

Now let’s talk about Growth Mindset & Learning. Show that you’re someone who’s always learning. Mention recent skills you’ve developed or tools you’ve adopted. You can also prepare questions about the company's tech stack; this shows genuine interest and a mindset geared toward growth.

Professional Branding & Personal Value Proposition is about selling yourself. Think about what sets you apart—your unique strengths or experiences. Make sure your online profiles like LinkedIn reflect your current skills. A personal story that connects your passion to your career is a great way to leave an impression.

Then we have Company & Role Familiarity. Take the time to research the company. This includes knowing their main technologies, mission, values, and recent projects. Showing alignment with the company’s work is a big plus.

Finally, Behavioral & Team Collaboration Skills. Here, you want to prepare examples of teamwork, feedback, and conflict resolution. Behavioral questions are common in technical interviews, so being ready with real examples can make a big difference.
