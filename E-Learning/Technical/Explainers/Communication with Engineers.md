# Title: 5 Rules for Communicating Effectively with Engineers (with examples).  

# Promise/Hook
- Do you sweat and panic every time you have to discuss technical information with your colleagues? Do you feel the world shrinking around you with judging eyes whenever you want to explain yourself? I've been there many times and it's awful.

In this video, I will share with you 5 rules of engagement that matter to your tech colleagues and that, if applied correctly, will be a game-changer for your relationships with your colleagues and your overall self-confidence. Let's go!

# Intro
Hi, I’m PK, and welcome to my channel. I’m an aerospace engineer with over 17 years of experience, and I'm here to help you reach your full potential in your tech career or business.

# Story
- I used to stutter. Yep! In my mid-twenties, I could not speak to more than one person at a time. 
- I would break into an uncontrollable sweat and blackout on what to say.
- I had trouble speaking to girls because I was too shy even saying my own name!
- But over time, I started learning different rules that enabled me to be understood and grow in confidence about what I wanted to say.
- So...

# Rule 1: Brevity (Daily stand-up)
- Example: Long-winded answers, complicated jargon!
- Solution: "The punchline is...", "In one sentence..." AND deliver!

# Rule 2: Objectivity (Email summary)
- Example: General comments like "Always" or "Never" 
- Solution: "It was failed the last xx times since...", ""

# Rule 3: Fail and Shout (Talk in the kitchenette)
- Problem: Asking the same questions and failing big!
- Solution: "Can I show you my progress since...", "I tried xx and yy but still not working with..."

# Rule 5: Stop and Ask (Planning meeting)
- Problem: You pretend you understood but do something else and try to defend your approach. 
- Solution: "If I were to summarize...", "In other words..."

# Rule 5: Complexity made Easy (Technical Review)
- Problem: Presenting random results without "effective review" or "conclusions"
- Solution: Rules of 5: Background, Current Results, Proposed Solution, Updated Results and Conclusions.
  - The rest is optional!
