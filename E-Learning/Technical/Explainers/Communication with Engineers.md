Hi, I’m PK, and welcome to my channel. I’m an aerospace engineer with over 17 years of experience, and I'm here to help you reach your full potential in your tech career or business.

# Rule 1: Brevity (Daily stand-up)
- Example: Long-winded answers, complicated jargon!
- Solution: "The punchline is...", "In one sentence..." AND deliver!

# Rule 2: Objectivity (Email summary)

- Solution: "It was failed the last xx times since...", ""

# Rule 3: Fail and Shout (Talk in the kitchenette)
