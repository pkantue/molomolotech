# Title: 5 Rules for Communicating Effectively with Engineers (with examples).  

# Promise/Hook
- Do you sweat and panic every time you have to discuss technical information with your colleagues? Do you feel the world shrinking around you with judging eyes whenever you want to explain yourself? I've been there many times and it's awful.

In this video, I will share with you 5 rules of engagement that matter to your tech colleagues and that, if applied correctly, will be a game-changer for your relationships with your colleagues and your overall self-confidence. Let's go!

# Intro
Hi, I’m Dr. PK. Welcome to my channel. I’m an aerospace engineer with over 17 years of experience, and I'm here to help you reach your full potential in your tech career or business.

# Story
- I used to stutter. Yep! In my mid-twenties, I could not speak to more than one person at a time. 
- I would break into an uncontrollable sweat and blackout on whatever I needed to say.
- I had trouble speaking to girls because I was too shy even to say my own name!
- But over time, I started learning different rules and techniques that enabled me to be understood and grow in confidence about what I wanted to say.
- So...

# Rule 1: Brevity (Daily stand-up - to give tasks summary of Yesterday/Today)
- Example: Long-winded answers, complicated jargon!
- Solution: "The punchline is...", "In one sentence..." AND deliver!

# Rule 2: Objectivity (e.g. Email summary of your results)
- Example: General comments like "Always" or "Never"
- Engineers are interested in facts and not gossip. You have to read the room.
- Solution: "It was failed the last xx times since...",
- Talk about facts and not speculation.

# Rule 3: Fail and Shout (Learn the kitchen talk)
- Problem: Asking the same questions and failing big!
- Learn to fail small by asking for input early when stuck.
- Solution: "Can I show you my progress since...", "I tried xx and yy but still not working with..."

# Rule 5: Stop and Ask (e.g. Planning meeting)
- Problem: You pretend you understood the tasks and milestones that are highlighted in the plan but you end doing something else and try to defend your approach when you're challenged. 
- Solution: "If I were to summarize...", "In other words..."
- This enables you to create a mental model of what was said and shows your willingness to pay attention to detail. 

# Rule 5: Complexity Made Easy (e.g. Technical Review)
- Problem: Presenting random results without "effective review" or "conclusions"
- This often happens when you have self-doubt on the work you've done.
- This approach leaves more questions than answers and creates more doubt from your colleagues.
- Solution: Rules of 5: Background, Current Results, Proposed Solution, Updated Results and Conclusions.
- The rest is optional!
