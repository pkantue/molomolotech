### 1. **Establish Context:**
- *Who Moved My Cheese* encourages us to understand that change is inevitable. In the risk management process, this step is about setting the scope, environment, and criteria for risk assessment. 
- **Parallel:** Like the characters realizing the need to explore beyond their current "cheese station," this step involves identifying the operational and strategic context of your project. Understand the internal and external factors (e.g., stakeholders, market conditions) that could affect the outcomes.
- **Relevant Image:** A maze with a clear path in one section and many unknown, blocked areas elsewhere—illustrating the need to map the current context before navigating risks.

### 2. **Risk Identification:**
- The characters in the book must recognize when their cheese (opportunities/resources) is gone. Risk identification is about actively recognizing threats and opportunities.
- **Parallel:** Just as the characters look for new cheese, you must identify potential risks by asking, "What could go wrong?" or "What new opportunities could we pursue?" This involves understanding potential changes in market dynamics, technology, or project objectives.
- **Relevant Image:** Two characters looking at an empty cheese station with question marks over their heads, symbolizing the process of identifying what risks (or missing cheese) might lie ahead.

### 3. **Risk Analysis:**
- Hem and Haw analyze their situation differently—Hem fears change, while Haw embraces it and moves forward.
- **Parallel:** In risk analysis, this is where you assess the likelihood and impact of each risk. Like Haw, you need to analyze each risk with an open mind and adapt to new data or realities. This step helps prioritize risks based on their potential to affect your project.
- **Relevant Image:** A set of scales weighing different blocks of cheese, representing different risks, with one character calculating and evaluating each block’s size and weight (symbolizing severity and likelihood).

### 4. **Risk Evaluation:**
- Haw constantly evaluates the situation by checking new cheese locations and adjusting his route accordingly.
- **Parallel:** In risk evaluation, you compare the identified risks with your project’s risk appetite and objectives. Which risks are acceptable, and which require mitigation? Much like evaluating whether the new "cheese" found is worth pursuing, this step is about deciding which risks are worth taking or avoiding.
- **Relevant Image:** A road sign showing multiple paths: one leading to cheese, the others leading to dead ends. The characters are standing in front, deciding which path to follow, symbolizing risk prioritization.

### 5. **Treat Risks:**
- Once Haw discovers new cheese, he takes action to enjoy it while staying prepared for future changes.
- **Parallel:** Risk treatment involves taking action to mitigate or capitalize on risks. Just like Haw embraced change, this step involves creating strategies to reduce risk impacts or take advantage of new opportunities. These strategies could include contingency planning, risk transfer, or implementing new policies.
- **Relevant Image:** A character sprinting toward a pile of fresh cheese with tools in hand, illustrating the action of mitigating risks and embracing new opportunities proactively.

By embracing the philosophy of flexibility and adaptation from *Who Moved My Cheese*, you can enhance your risk management approach to be proactive and resilient in an ever-changing environment.
