Imagine coming home to that!!!! All dog owners can relate, right? The first question that comes to mind is, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING? The answer that most dogs would give, if they could talk would be, I was thinking of YOU!
In this video, we are going to talk about three barriers to communication you should take seriously and learn from our interactions with dogs that can help you be better in 2025.

## Intro
Hi, I'm Dr. PK. Welcome to my channel. I'm an aerospace engineer with over 17 years of experience and I'm here to help you reach your full potential in your tech career or business. I make videos to that inspire you to change 

## Background
- A couple of days ago, in one of my technical sessions, I became very frustrated and visibly annoyed with one of my interns.
- He has been unable to communicate his progress clearly and had a nonchalant attitude toward improving that. 
- I soon realised that despite his best efforts, he was unaware of his communication walls.
- These barriers prevented him from explaining his technical progress.
- And even more concerning, he lacked the confidence to know HOW to ask for help.
- So this is the basis for this video!  

## Context
- Alright, this is Obelix. He's 10 years old.
- Unlike his older brother Asterix, who passed away a couple of months ago, he was a lot harder to train.
- He seems calm now, but he was completely different a couple of years ago!
- He was such a wild and free spirit, unwilling to listen or take instruction.
- My complex relationship with him reminded me of my journey to remove my communication barriers and improve my relationship with my dogs.
- Learning to identify those barriers, surprisingly shaped other areas of my life, including my career.
- So let's go through some of them...  

## Lack of Clarity
- Non-verbal communication is key - this is even more important with dogs
- Analogy - Instructions to dogs (e.g use of the leash).

## Segway

## Lack of effort
- Communication is a skill - you need to keep working on it (reading books, presenting at conferences, etc...)
- Analogy - dog house rules.

## Lack of Vision
- You need to recognize your Communication level (written, spoken, etc...)
- Analogy - Learn "Sit", before "Roll-Over".

## Questions
Do you agree with these barriers to communicating effectively? Are there other barriers that should be mentioned? Please leave them in the comments below.
