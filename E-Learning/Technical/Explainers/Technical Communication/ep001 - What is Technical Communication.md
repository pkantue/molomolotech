*[Slide: "What is Technical Communication?"]*  

**[Host]:**  
Technical communication is like clearing a forest trail.  
It turns complex ideas into clear and useful information.  
Too much detail? It overwhelms.  
Too little? It confuses.  

Use this skill for:  
- Documentation / Reports
- Manuals / Specifications  
- Presentations  

The goal: Clear, focused, and impactful messages.  

*[Slide: "Key Elements of Technical Communication"]*  

Good communication ensures your message is:  
- **Clear** – Easy to understand at a glance.  
- **Concise** – No clutter to distract the audience.  
- **Targeted** – Tailored for your audience’s needs.  

Let me share my story.  

**[Host]:**  
I used to feel stuck as an engineer.  
I worked hard but wasn’t moving forward.  
My reports and presentations were too detailed.  
People couldn’t follow my ideas.  

Then I met a mentor.  
They showed me how to simplify and guide others.  
It changed everything.  
I learned to focus on clarity, not just detail.  
Now, I help others do the same.  

*[Cut to a scene: Host walking on a forest trail.]*  

**[Host voice-over]:**  
Think of technical communication as guiding others through a forest.  
Your job is to clear the trail just enough.  
Not too much, not too little.  

Simplify where possible.  
Focus on what matters to your audience.  
Help them move forward with confidence.

**[Host]:**  
Here’s an example:  
Alex, a backend engineer, writes dense documentation.  
The front-end team can’t understand it.  
They waste hours trying to figure it out.  
The project falls behind.  

Now imagine Alex simplified it.  
Clear explanations, simple examples.  
The team moves forward quickly.  
That’s the power of great communication.
