# Title: What Dogs Can Teach Us About Breaking Barriers to Communication

*[Upbeat intro music fades out]*  

**[Host]:**  
Imagine coming home to that! *[Cut to video of a dog’s mischievous mess.]* All dog owners can relate, right? The first question that comes to mind is, *“WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?”* And if dogs could talk, most would answer, *“I was thinking of YOU!”*  

In this video, we’ll talk about three barriers to communication you should take seriously. And we’ll learn from our interactions with dogs how to be better communicators in 2025.  

## Intro  
Hi, I'm Dr. PK. With 17 years in aerospace engineering, I’m here to help you grow your tech career or business with the right tools, strategies, and mindset. If this interests you, please subscribe and join the journey!  

## Background  
- A couple of weeks ago, in one of my technical sessions, I became very frustrated and visibly annoyed with one of my interns.  
- He struggled to communicate his progress clearly and seemed uninterested in improving that.  
- I soon realized that despite his best efforts, he was unaware of the barriers blocking his communication.  
- These walls stopped him from explaining his technical progress effectively and, worse, eroded his confidence to *ask* for help.  
- This experience inspired this video.  

## Context  
- Meet Obelix, my 10-year-old dog. Unlike his older brother Asterix, who sadly passed away a few months ago, Obelix was a challenge to train.  
- He’s calm now, but a few years ago, he was a wild, free spirit—unwilling to listen or follow instructions.  
- My complex relationship with Obelix reminded me of my journey to confront my own communication barriers, both with him and in my professional life.  
- Identifying and overcoming those barriers changed not only my relationship with Obelix but also how I approach communication in my career. Let’s go through these barriers together.  

## Barrier 1: Lack of Clarity  
- Non-verbal communication is crucial—this applies to dogs and humans alike.  
- Think about giving instructions to a dog: when using a leash, your tone, body language, and consistency must align. Mixed signals confuse them.  
- The same happens in the workplace. For example, a smile, a warm greeting, or even a simple “thank you” are small, clear actions that reinforce understanding and connection. Without clarity, misunderstandings grow.  

## Barrier 2: Lack of Effort  
- Communication isn’t something you’re born perfect at—it’s a skill that requires effort and practice.  
- With Obelix, I had to establish “dog house rules.” Consistent reinforcement and regular training turned chaos into trust.  
- For humans, this translates to investing in yourself: read books, present at conferences, or take up small communication challenges. It’s the only way to see growth.

## Barrier 3: Lack of Vision  
- You need to recognize your current communication level before setting goals.  
- For example, teaching a dog to “sit” is essential before moving on to more complex tricks like “roll over.” The same applies to communication: master foundational skills like written clarity before tackling advanced presentations.  
- Understanding where you are and where you want to go helps you break communication into achievable steps.
