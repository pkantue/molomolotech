### **Transcript: How to use MATLAB Online Step By Step Tutorial in 2024**  

**[Opening Scene: Calm music fades in with the title: "How to Use MATLAB Online - Step-by-Step Tutorial for Beginners."]**  

**[On-Screen Presenter/Voiceover]:**  
"Hi, and welcome to this beginner-friendly tutorial on using MATLAB Online! Whether you're on the go or don’t have MATLAB installed on your computer, MATLAB Online lets you run and test your code directly in a web browser. In just five minutes, I’ll show you how to get started, write some basic code, and explore key features."

### **Part 1: Accessing MATLAB Online**  
**[Presenter switches to a browser screen showing the MATLAB Online homepage.]**  
"To access MATLAB Online, open your web browser and go to [MATLAB Online](https://matlab.mathworks.com). You’ll need a MathWorks account. If you don’t have one, you can create it for free using your email address."  

**[Presenter logs in and lands on the MATLAB Online interface.]**  
"Once you log in, you’ll see a familiar MATLAB environment with the Command Window, Workspace, and Current Folder, just like the desktop version."  

---

### **Part 2: Writing Your First Code**  
**[Presenter clicks on the Command Window.]**  
"Let’s start with a simple command. In the Command Window, type:  
```matlab
disp('Hello, MATLAB Online!')
```  
and press Enter."  

**[Presenter runs the command and shows the output in the Command Window.]**  
"This displays the text 'Hello, MATLAB Online!' in the Command Window. It’s a quick way to test your environment."  

---

### **Part 3: Creating and Running a Script**  
**[Presenter navigates to the Current Folder panel.]**  
"Next, let’s create a script. In the Current Folder panel, click the 'New Script' button."  

**[Presenter switches to the Editor tab.]**  
"This opens the Editor, where you can write a script. Let’s type a short program to calculate the area of a circle:  
```matlab
radius = 5;  
area = pi * radius^2;  
disp(['The area of the circle is: ', num2str(area)]);
```  

**[Presenter saves the script as `circle_area.m`.]**  
"Save the script with the name `circle_area.m` and press the Run button at the top."  

**[Presenter shows the output in the Command Window.]**  
"The result will appear in the Command Window, showing the area of the circle."

### **Part 4: Exploring Built-In Apps**  
**[Presenter clicks on the 'Apps' tab in the MATLAB Online interface.]**  
"One of the coolest features of MATLAB Online is the built-in apps. These apps let you perform complex tasks, like data analysis and machine learning, with a graphical interface. Let’s explore the 'Curve Fitting Tool' as an example."  

**[Presenter opens the Curve Fitting Tool and briefly demonstrates loading a dataset.]**  
"Here, you can load a dataset, select a model, and instantly visualize the fit. It’s a powerful way to analyze data without writing a lot of code."  

---

### **Part 5: Sharing and Collaborating**  
**[Presenter clicks on the 'Home' tab and shows the Share button.]**  
"Another great feature of MATLAB Online is collaboration. Click the 'Share' button to generate a link to your script or project. You can share it with teammates, and they can view or edit it in real-time. This is perfect for group projects or remote work."

### **Recap and Next Steps**  
**[Presenter switches back to a camera view or static slide.]**  
"In this tutorial, we logged into MATLAB Online, wrote a simple script, explored built-in apps, and learned how to share projects with others. It’s easy to use and incredibly versatile for coding on the go. In the next video, we’ll introduce Simulink Online using a real-world example."
