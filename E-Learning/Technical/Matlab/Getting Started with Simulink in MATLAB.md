### Getting Started with Simulink in MATLAB Online

**[Opening Scene: Calm music fades in with the title screen showing "How to Use Simulink in MATLAB - Getting Started."]**  

**[On-Screen Presenter/Voiceover]:**  
"Welcome to this quick tutorial on getting started with Simulink in MATLAB. In this video:
- I will introduce you to Simulink in Matlab
- We’ll create a simple model to simulate how solar energy affects water flow in a pump.
- This is perfect if you're new to Simulink and Matlab and want to learn by solving a real-world problem."  


### **Part 1: Opening Simulink**  
**[Presenter switches to MATLAB screen.]**  
"First, let’s open Simulink. We will use MATLAB Online which is free to access and doesn't require a fancy computer. 
- Go to the Command Window and type `Simulink`.
- This opens the Simulink Start Page. Here, you’ll find templates and examples, but for now, select 'Blank Model' to start fresh."
- On the top bar, the green button starts and stops the simulation.
- On the left, you’ll find the Library Browser, which contains all the blocks you’ll use to build your model.
- The centre is the canvas where you’ll build your simulation."
- Simulink works just like a Word document file. You can open, save, and save-as different Simulink models.

### **Part 2: Adding Solar Energy Input**  
**[Presenter navigates to the Library Browser.]**  
"Our first step is to simulate solar energy. 
- In the Library Browser, go to the 'Sources' section and find the 'Signal Generator' block.
- Drag it onto the canvas."  

**[Presenter drags and drops the block.]**  
"The Signal Generator will simulate the varying intensity of solar energy throughout the day."  

**[Presenter double-clicks on the Signal Generator block.]**  
"Double-click the block to configure it. 
- Change the waveform to 'Sine', set the amplitude to '1', and the frequency to '0.1'.
- This setup will create a smooth wave, representing solar energy rising and falling over a day."  

### **Part 3: Representing the Water Pump**  
**[Presenter adds a Gain block.]**  
"Next, let’s simulate how the solar energy powers the water pump. 
- For this, we’ll use a Gain block from the 'Math Operations' library.
- Drag it onto the canvas and connect it to the Signal Generator."  

**[Presenter connects the blocks and configures the Gain block.]**  
"The Gain block scales the solar energy input to represent the water flow. 
- Set the Gain value to '5'.
- This means the pump will produce 5 liters of water for every unit of solar energy."  

### **Part 4: Visualizing the Results**  
**[Presenter adds a Scope block from the 'Sinks' library.]**  
"Finally, let’s see the results. 
- Add a Scope block to visualize the water flow.
- Connect it to the output of the Gain block."  

**[Presenter connects the Scope block and adjusts its position.]**  
"Your model is now complete! You’ve linked solar energy to water flow through the pump."  


### **Part 5: Running the Simulation**  
**[Presenter clicks the Run button in Simulink.]**  
"Now, it’s time to run the simulation. Click the 'Run' button in the toolbar."  

**[Presenter opens the Scope block to show the results.]**  
"When the simulation finishes, double-click the Scope block to view the water flow. 
- You’ll see a smooth wave, scaled by the Gain block to represent water pumped over time."

### **Part 6: Recap and Next Steps**  
**[Presenter switches back to a camera view or static slide.]**  
"In this tutorial, we built a simple model to simulate a solar-powered water pump. 
- You learned how to use basic Simulink blocks, configure them, and visualize the results. 
- In the next video, we’ll take this model further by adding real-world variations like fluctuating solar energy during cloudy weather."
