% Objective: Provide an overview of Simulink and demonstrate how to create a basic model.
% Key Topics:
% Creating a basic Simulink model: drag-and-drop blocks, connecting them, and configuring parameters.
% Simulating the solar intensity data from MATLAB using a From Workspace block.
% Visualizing the results with a Scope block.
% Practical Demonstration:
% Model a simple system where solar intensity (input) is processed to output electrical power using a gain block for efficiency.
% include random noise block
