% Objective: Build a detailed Simulink Solar panel model to simulate the relationship between solar intensity, panel output.
% Key Topics: two-part series
% Adding a MATLAB Function Block to use the noise-added solar intensity data.
% part1
% Simulating a solar panelâ€™s behavior using a lookup table or equations.
% creating a subsystem of solar panel and connect to current simulation model.
% part2
% Add cloud cover to the solar intensity to show the power output of the solar panel.
% add a bus to show flow of information, including the Save to File.
