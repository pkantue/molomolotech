% Objective: Build a detailed Simulink model to simulate the relationship between solar intensity, panel output, and pump performance.
% Key Topics:
% Adding a MATLAB Function Block to use the noise-added solar intensity data.
% Simulating a solar panel’s behavior using a lookup table or equations.
% Introducing a Subsystem Block for the pump, using parameters like efficiency and flow rate per kW.
% Demonstrating conditional logic (e.g., pump shutoff when power is below a threshold) with a Switch Block.
% Practical Demonstration:
% Create a model where solar intensity drives the pump’s flow rate, and visualize the system's behavior over time using the Scope and XY Graph blocks.
% add logic for cyclic loading of data.
