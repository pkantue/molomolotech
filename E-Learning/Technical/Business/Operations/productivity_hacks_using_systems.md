Business Productivity Hacks Using Systems Engineering 

[INTRO – Hook]

"So you decided to digitize your business, embrace tech apps, and now you're more stressed than ever."

"You use all these different apps, most of them don’t integrate, your IT guy only brings problems, and your employees seem to have constant amnesia when it comes to critical tasks. Now, instead of running your business, tech is running you. Sound familiar?"

"In this video, I’m going to share some productivity hacks that will help you understand the system your business operates in and how to better leverage technology to regain control."

"Hi, I’m Dr. PK, and welcome to my channel."

[INTRO – Why Systems Thinking Matters]

"Now that I’m in the consulting and coaching industry, I see too many businesses struggling with a simple truth: every business, no matter how big or small, runs within a system. The sooner you become a student of that system, the sooner you move from self-employment to being a true business owner."

"And here’s the kicker: The same principles that help aerospace engineers design aircraft can also help you design a business that works smoothly and efficiently. Let’s break this down."

1. Define Clear Objectives – Use System Requirements Engineering

"First, you need to define what success looks like. Most businesses fail because their goals are too vague. Just like in aerospace, we use requirements management to break down system goals into measurable objectives. Do this for your business by setting clear KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and making sure everything you do aligns with these targets."

2. Optimize Processes – Use Functional Decomposition

"If your business processes feel overwhelming, you need to break them down. Engineers call this functional decomposition—taking a big, complex system and dividing it into smaller, manageable parts. Identify repetitive tasks, automate where possible, and delegate effectively."

3. Prioritize Decision-Making – Apply Trade-Off Analysis

"Every business decision has trade-offs. Should you spend more on marketing or product development? Should you hire in-house or outsource? Engineers use multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to weigh options systematically. You can apply this by listing your options, assigning scores based on cost, benefit, and risk, and making decisions backed by data—not just gut instinct."

4. Streamline Communication – Use Interface Control

"Poor communication kills productivity. Systems engineers prevent this by using Interface Control Documents (ICDs) to define how different parts of a system interact. In your business, this means setting up clear reporting structures, standardizing communication tools, and making sure information flows seamlessly across departments."

5. Automate and Integrate – Apply Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)

"If you're drowning in apps that don’t talk to each other, it’s time to integrate. The solution? Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)—a method engineers use to simulate and optimize complex systems. In business terms, this means choosing platforms that work together, automating workflows, and using APIs to sync your tech stack."

6. Risk Management – Use Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)

"What happens when things go wrong? Instead of firefighting, learn from FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis)—a method that predicts where failures might occur and develops mitigation plans in advance. Create a risk register for your business, identifying possible risks and assigning contingency actions."

7. Continuous Improvement – Apply Agile and Iterative Development

"Business growth isn’t a one-time event; it’s an ongoing process. In engineering, we use Agile and Lean Six Sigma to refine systems iteratively. Apply this by setting up Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycles, continuously testing new strategies, and refining your approach based on feedback."

8. Manage Resources Efficiently – Apply Systems Architecture

"Finally, how you allocate your time, money, and people determines your success. Engineers use Work Breakdown Structures (WBS) and PERT charts to visualize dependencies and optimize timelines. Do this in your business by breaking big projects into smaller tasks and ensuring each resource is utilized effectively."
