# Title: Why Getting 100 YouTube Subscribers is HARDER THAN EVER

## Hook: Growing on Youtube is like rock climbing with swimming equipment
It took over 9 months since starting my channel to reach 100 subscribers with over 96 videos (shorts and long-form).

## What kept you motivated despite the slow growth?
You must keep asking the "why" t<question to your older self who has achieved a major goal 5-10 years from now. 

Since it took a lot of time and effort, people would be curious about what drove you to continue creating content and pushing through moments of doubt or exhaustion.

## How has your content evolved as you've grown and searched for your identity?
- You will learn to find your voice if your message is broad enough.
- Watch Out! There's alot of noise on Youtube!!! Learn to have a filter!
- Everybody has an opinion and eventually wants to sell you something.

Given that you mentioned personal identity searching, people would be interested in how your content and personal expression changed over time to reflect this journey.

## What lessons have you learned from the experience that you wish you knew earlier?
- If possible, start short-form (over 1min) explainer videos and build up to long-form video podcasts. Explan why?
- This is not a corporate workplace. You don't have to be a guru to help someone. 
-
