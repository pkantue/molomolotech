### **Key Takeaways: I Got Fired... What About Personal Branding?**  
**(Navigating Corporate Contracts vs. Independent Work – The Lion & Leopard Approach)**  

#### **1. Know Your Role: Are You a Corporate Contributor (Lion) or a Self-Sufficient Expert (Leopard)?**  
- **Corporate contracts (Lion mindset)**: You integrate into a team, align with company culture, and demonstrate reliability. Your value comes from collaboration and fitting into a system.  
- **Freelance/self-employed work (Leopard mindset)**: You operate independently, define your own niche, and position yourself as an expert rather than just a job-seeker.  
- **Balance the two**: If unemployed, don’t just search for full-time roles—consider contract gigs to build experience and cash flow while strengthening your personal brand.  

#### **2. Build a Personal Brand That Appeals to Both Worlds**  
- A strong **corporate** brand signals that you’re dependable, skilled at teamwork, and fit well into structured environments.  
- A strong **self-employed** brand highlights your unique skills, problem-solving ability, and ability to deliver value on a project-by-project basis.  
- If unemployed, your brand should tell a **cohesive story** that works for both: Show you can **thrive in a team but also bring independent expertise.**  

#### **3. Position Yourself for Visibility & Opportunity**  
- **For corporate contracts**: Engage on LinkedIn, attend industry events, and build relationships with recruiters who specialize in contract roles.  
- **For independent work**: Have a personal website, showcase a portfolio, and create content that highlights your expertise.  
- **If unemployed, do both**: Position yourself as someone who **adds value quickly**—whether through a contract role or as a consultant.  

#### **4. Stay Flexible & Adaptable to New Work Models**  
- **Corporate contracts** can be a stepping stone to full-time roles, so treat them professionally and build strong relationships.  
- **Freelance work** can be a bridge to new industries, especially if you’re pivoting or trying to stay relevant.  
- If unemployed, consider **hybrid income streams**—short-term contracts, consulting, part-time gigs—while continuing your full-time job search.  

#### **5. Confidence & Consistency Matter—Regardless of Employment Status**  
- Whether working on a short-term contract or freelancing, act like a **trusted professional, not just a job-seeker.**  
- Be proactive in marketing yourself, whether that’s through networking, thought leadership, or direct outreach.  
- Maintain consistency in your personal brand—whether applying for corporate roles or pitching yourself for independent work.
