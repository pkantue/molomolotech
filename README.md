# Welcome
Hi I'm Dr. Paulin Kantue and welcome to my GitHub page. I'm an aerospace engineer with over 17 years of experience and I've created Molomolo Tech Studios to share my technical knowledge, personal experiences and love for the African continent.

# Our Mission
Molomolo Tech Studios is here to teach and motivate you to reach your full potential in your tech career or business, develop a resilient mindset and find a balanced purpose for your life. 

We achieve that by making YouTube videos, hosting a bi-weekly podcast called African Tech Stories and technical coaching sessions. With almost 20 years in the tech industry, I'm growing a community where I connect industry experts with like-minded tech professionals looking to boost their tech careers or businesses.

## Stories
The **[MoloMolo African Tech Stories](/Podcast)** focuses on sharing untold or forgotten stories of African Champions and innovators shaping the future of the African Continent through technology. The purpose is to inspire a mindset change towards the African continent using vibrant conversations.
