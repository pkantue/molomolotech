Every year, over a period of 3 months, over 20% of Nigeria's food-producing farmland gets flooded and its farmers workers and millions of people of Sahel region face a food crisis to the point of starvation. Every. Single. Year!
- Now, considering how important agriculture is worldwide, why aren't tech companies targeting to improve this industry above all others?
- This is the first episode of Molomolo Marual Bytes, where we give our opinion on trending news that are affecting the daily lives of Africans.

I'm Dr Paulin Kantue, Let's go!

# Introduction
This week, news outlets sounded the alarm on the Sahel/Sub-Sahara region and neighbouring areas about the risk of floods due to the high rainfall, which has the potential to erode large areas of farmland across multiple countries.

# Problem/Challenge
Recent research (2023) investigated the impact of floods on agriculture-dependent livelihoods in Sub-sahara Africa.

The impact of floods on food security and spread of disease can be divided into themes.

## The Influence of the Small farms on global food production
- Globally, approximately 2.5 billion people, of which 60% reside in developing countries, depend almost entirely on agriculture for their livelihoods.
- Agriculture generates over half of the global food production on small farms.

## The severity of floods worldwide
- Floods account for 44% of all the registered disaster events
- Floods are on top the list of natural disasters in terms of economic damages. 

## Risk of Small farms in extreme weather conditions
- In the event of extreme weather conditions, small farms to adopt more low-tech and ad-hoc flood
management strategies, such as temporary migration, gift economy, and mutual aid.
- This is due to weak disaster management institutions and inadequate preparedness. 

## Impact on Food Security and Soil Erosion
- The loss of household and farm assets, e.g., stored crops and livestock.
but also indirectly through the loss of labour, either to death or forced migration, or to soil destruction and land degradation; these may
cumulatively culminate in a decline in food production. Land contamination may impair food production further.

## Impact on health and sanitation
- The threat of disease outbreaks is elevated during the rainy season.
- Backflow from drains that has mixed with floodwaters can become trapped in open areas when inundations recede.
- These stagnant pools often become a breeding ground for mosquitoes and bacteria, increasing the incidence of insect- and waterborne diseases.
- Exposure to contaminated water from inundated industrial sites, sewer systems, and septic tanks also poses a significant health threat.

# Climax/Key Moment
The above themes essentially create a systemic problem, best described as a feedback loop better known as a Causal Loop Diagram:
1. Poor preventative measures and extreme climate causes "Floods" which effects "Soil Degradation," and "Soil Erosion."
2. This causes "Reduced Crop Yields," "Livestock Losses," and "Increased Food Insecurity."
3. This results in "Increased Poverty," "Migration," and "Limited Adaptive Capacity."
4. Which results in "reduced Preventative measures", "Increased sensitivity to extreme climate".

# Conclusion/Summary
Unless that feedback loop is broken, these type of news will continue to happen and more dependency of foreign aid will continue with little incentive for a long-term solution.
- What is the solution for such regions?
- The use of floating farms in Bangladesh - see video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhttuMh0V9Q
- How can Tech help alleviate the pressure on the poverty line and improve resilience against extreme conditions?
