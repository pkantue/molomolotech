### **HOOK (0:00 - 0:30)**

*Scene opens with a dramatic pan over famous stolen artifacts like the Benin Bronzes, and then cuts to footage of protests and African art exhibitions.*

**Narrator (V.O.):**
(with intence music)
Priceless treasures, stolen legacies—pieces of history scattered across foreign museums, far from their true home. The fight to bring back Africa's stolen art has reached a boiling point, but why do former colonial powers like the UK and France resist returning these artifacts? And what does it mean for the people of Africa?

### **INTRO WITH FACTS (0:30 - 2:00)**

*Footage of the British Museum, the Louvre, and artifacts such as the Benin Bronzes, the Rosetta Stone, and Egyptian treasures.*
*Images of colonial soldiers carrying away treasures, alongside numbers of known items in foreign collections.*

**Narrator (V.O.):**  
- In the halls of the world’s most prestigious museums, Africa's cultural heritage remains imprisoned. 
- More than 90% of Africa’s cultural artifacts are estimated to be held outside the continent.
- This includes objects taken during colonial times—many of them stolen in violent raids or deceitful transactions."
- British Museum alone holds over 700 objects from the Kingdom of Benin
- France’s Musée du quai Branly stores over 70,000 pieces of African art.
- These treasures are more than just decorative items—they represent centuries of culture, history, and identity.

*Cut to a scene from the upcoming documentary, "Dahomey," showing the royal treasures being returned.*

**Narrator (V.O.):**  
"This episode was inspired by the soon-to-be-released documentary *Dahomey,* directed by Mati Diop, which dramatizes the return of 26 royal treasures from France to Benin. But why does it take a documentary, countless protests, and years of negotiation to return what was never theirs in the first place?"

### **CONTENT (2:00 - 8:00)**

*The screen shows a map of Africa with items pinpointed across Europe.*

**Narrator (V.O.):**  
"To understand the resistance from colonial powers like the UK and France, we need to explore a few key questions."

#### **1. Why are colonial powers still holding on?**

*Footage of debates in the British Parliament and the French Senate.*

**Narrator (V.O.):**  
"Some say it's about preserving world history, but who decides what part of the world gets to keep it? Many European institutions argue that they are ‘protecting’ the art or that these pieces have become part of their own cultural identity. But this begs the question: can you claim ownership of something stolen?"

*Cut to news footage of protests in Nigeria, Benin, and Senegal demanding the return of cultural treasures.*

**Narrator (V.O.):**  
"Imagine having parts of your heritage displayed for foreign audiences while your own people are denied access to their cultural history. It’s a painful reality for many Africans. When these artifacts are exhibited abroad, they are presented as exotic novelties—objects of study rather than as symbols of cultural pride."

#### **2. What does this loss mean for African culture?**

*Scenes of African children learning about their history in a museum in Europe.*

**Narrator (V.O.):**  
"Colonialism wasn’t just about stealing land or resources—it was about stealing identities. These artifacts are key to understanding Africa's rich traditions, religions, and societal structures. Without them, a part of Africa's soul remains missing. How can African nations rebuild their past when the pieces are in foreign hands?"

*Footage of African artists and historians speaking about the importance of cultural heritage.*

**Narrator (V.O.):**  
"Returning these items is not just about restitution—it’s about healing centuries of wounds. It’s about reclaiming history and restoring pride for future generations. As these treasures remain outside Africa, it prolongs a legacy of injustice."

#### **3. Why the resistance?**

*Cuts to interviews with historians and art experts.*

**Narrator (V.O.):**  
"Despite growing international pressure, there’s a fear among colonial powers that returning artifacts could trigger a domino effect. If they return African treasures, what stops other countries from demanding their own cultural heritage back? These museums could lose thousands of significant items, along with millions in tourism revenue."

*Cut to scenes of empty museum halls in Europe.*

**Narrator (V.O.):**  
"But what is more important—money or moral responsibility? Is it right to profit off the stolen legacy of another people?"

### **CONCLUSION: How Can Technology Play a Part? (8:00 - 10:00)**

*Footage of people scanning artifacts and 3D printing them, as well as digital museums.*

**Narrator (V.O.):**  
"So, what can be done? Technology is already playing a role in the conversation about restitution. Digital archives and 3D scanning allow countries to create virtual collections, providing access to lost treasures while negotiations for their return continue."

*Cut to scenes of virtual museum tours and 3D-printed replicas being showcased in Africa.*

**Narrator (V.O.):**  
"Imagine if African children could walk through a virtual museum of their heritage, or if modern 3D printing allowed them to touch replicas of their ancestors' work. These are steps toward reclaiming identity, but it shouldn’t stop there."

*Footage from the "Dahomey" documentary of the royal treasures finally arriving home.*

**Narrator (V.O.):**  
"*Dahomey* shows us what true restitution can look like—when treasures are finally returned to their rightful owners. But it’s just one story in a larger struggle. Technology can help bridge the gap, but it’s only a tool. Real change will come when colonial powers stop resisting and start recognizing the value of cultural justice."

### **OUTRO (10:00)**

*Final scene of a map showing treasures in Africa being returned to their countries.*

**Narrator (V.O.):**  
"Artifacts don’t belong in the shadows of foreign museums. They belong in the hands of the people who created them. The time has come to restore what was taken. The question is—will the former colonial powers listen?"

*Closing title: "Inspired by the documentary *Dahomey*, directed by Mati Diop, premiering next week. Don’t miss it."*
