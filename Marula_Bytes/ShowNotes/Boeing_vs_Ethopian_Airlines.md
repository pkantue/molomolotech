**[Transcript for 5-8 Minute Video on Boeing & Ethiopian Airlines]**

"Today, we’re diving into a critical story — one that exposed not only a tragic failure in aviation but also the disparities between large corporations and African airlines. We're talking about Boeing and the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 on March 10, 2019, and how this accident revealed the exclusion of African carriers in the global aviation industry. Let's go!"

Hi, I'm Dr Paulin Kantue. Welcome to another episode of Marula Bytes. "In late 2018, Ethiopian Airlines reached out to Boeing with serious concerns. The chief pilot wanted more information about the Boeing 737 Max’s flight control system, especially after a Lion Air 737 Max aircraft had just crashed, killing everyone onboard. The Ethiopian carrier, flying the same plane, was worried about what might happen if a similar failure occurred."

**Host:**
"Here’s where it gets troubling. Instead of providing detailed guidance, Boeing gave vague responses and referred Ethiopian Airlines to a public document — basically brushing off their concerns. At the same time, U.S. pilots were getting in-depth briefings and detailed technical information from Boeing. This wasn’t just about a difference in communication; this was a dangerous oversight that would have fatal consequences."

**Host:**
"Fast forward just a few months—March 10, 2019. An Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 Max aircraft crashes, killing 157 people. The same flawed software that caused the Lion Air disaster was responsible. Yet, African pilots were left to deal with a problem that Boeing had discussed in-depth with their U.S. counterparts but had chosen not to share with Ethiopian Airlines."

[Pause, change in tone]

**Host:**
"This isn’t just a story of corporate oversight; it’s about how African airlines, like Ethiopian Airlines, are often treated as afterthoughts. When Boeing withheld crucial safety information, it highlighted a systemic issue—African airlines, despite their rapid growth and world-class operations, are excluded and not given the same respect as their Western counterparts. The lives lost in the Ethiopian crash remind us of the real cost of this exclusion."

[Cut to visuals of protests from families of the victims]

**Host:**
"Families of the victims have fought to hold Boeing accountable, but they’ve faced an uphill battle. While Boeing pleaded guilty to defrauding regulators, questions remain about whether they truly see African airlines as equal players in the global industry. African professionals, especially in tech and aviation, like yourself, must now ask: How do we ensure our voices are heard? How do we push back against a system that undervalues our expertise?"

[Scene shifts to tech professionals working in African startups]

**Host:**
"For African tech professionals and entrepreneurs, this story carries important lessons. It’s a reminder that in global industries, we must demand transparency and accountability. We have to ensure that when decisions are made, we are part of the conversation. Just as Ethiopian Airlines fought for answers, so must we when we deal with major corporations or global partners."

**Host:**
"So, what can we take away from this tragedy? African companies must not accept being sidelined. We deserve the same level of information, respect, and partnership as anyone else. For entrepreneurs and tech professionals, it's about pushing for better systems, calling out inequities, and making sure we’re not just part of the global market, but equal players in it."
